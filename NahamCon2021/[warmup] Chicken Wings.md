### What is Wingdings?

Wingdings is a typeface of the dingbat typographic family which renders a variety of symbols.
They were originally developed in 1990 by Microsoft, by combining different types of characters:
Lucida icons, arrows, and licensed stars of Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes.

Although its intention was to function separately, only to add a touch of creativity,
some users interpreted it as a font meant to write words and sentences.
